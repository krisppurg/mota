Discord bot that relays messages from the discord api server to dimscord server vice versa

I've had a thought of sharing my discord bot code into Github for anyone interested on how it works and either take it as reference.
The code may look somewhat unpolished  mediocre, but should not be too much a problem as long as it works :) 

Feel free for any suggestions into bot.

`config-example.json` is a file that contains the necessary bits e.g. webhook tokens and discord bot token.

## FAQ:
### Do you have any plans to migrate to dimscmd?
* Yes maybe sooner or later I'm not sure, since the bot was made before dimscmd was made.
### Does the bot support with other servers?
* Mainly the bot only supports relaying messages from discord api server to dimscord server (vice versa)
* It would be a good idea, but I have no plan to since the bot is meant to only be private. You can make your own bot that does the similar to mine by just changing the `config-example.json` and some bits in `main.nim`.
